;; Place downloaded elisp files in ~/emacs-for-clojure/vendor. You'll then be able
;; to load them.
;;
;; For example, if you download yaml-mode.el to ~/emacs-for-clojure/vendor,
;; then you can add the following code to this file:
;;
;; (require 'yaml-mode)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.yml$" . yaml-mode))
;; 
;; Adding this code will make Emacs enter yaml mode whenever you open
;; a .yml file

;; Customization
;;;;

;; Add a directory to our load path so that when you `load` things
;; below, Emacs knows where to look for the corresponding file.
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs-for-clojure/customizations")

;; Sets up exec-path-from-shell so that Emacs will use the correct
;; environment variables
(load "shell-integration.el")

;; These customizations make it easier for you to navigate files,
;; switch buffers, and choose options from the minibuffer.
(load "navigation.el")

;; These customizations change the way emacs looks and disable/enable
;; some user interface elements
(load "ui.el")

;; These customizations make editing a bit nicer.
(load "editing.el")

;; Hard-to-categorize customizations
(load "misc.el")

;; For editing lisps
(load "elisp-editing.el")

;; Langauage-specific
(load "setup-clojure.el")
(load "setup-js.el")
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
