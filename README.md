# Emacs for Clojure
This is a fork from [flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure) using the [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) package to manage plugins.

I also changed some paths as I use [chemacs](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs).

(I am not sure this works!)
